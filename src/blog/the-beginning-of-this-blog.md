# The Beginning of this Blog

Welcome to this blog! I've wanted to start one for a while, and hopefully it'll
eventually become a collection of my thoughts on all things computer science
related. Whether that means tutorials, ideas, or updates, I hope to put it all
on this site.

For a bit more information about me, check out the [home page](/). If you find
any bugs with the site, feel free to submit an issue through the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/dzfrias/blog) and I can work on fixing
it!
