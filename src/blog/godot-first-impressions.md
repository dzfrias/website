  My first impressions with the Godot game engine, after using Unity for two
  years.

The [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) game engine has risen in popularity over
the last few years. Beyond just being free and open-source, there's a lot to
like about the game engine; being relatively new (and willing to make big
breaking changes), Godot has the advantage of **hindsight**.[^hindsight]

Annually, my artist friends, programmer friends, and I make a video game over
the course of half a year. This year, we decided to use Godot instead of
[Unity](https://unity.com/). So, after using Godot for a little over a month,
I'm writing this post to document my highlights, complaints, and other thoughts
related to the engine.

# Highlights

## Economy of Features

By far, the best thing about Godot is its **economy of features**. By that, I
mean that Godot gets a way with having _a lot_ of power with a relatively small
set of features. It's no secret the game engines have to do a bunch of stuff for
us. They need to handle:

- Animations
- Shaders
- Rendering
- Physics/collisions

and much more. One of my main complaints about Unity was that, in order to
**dive deep** into any of these, it felt like I needed to watch a 20-minute-long
tutorial, even for things like basic animations.[^problem]

By contrast, I was able to grasp Godot's animation system almost instantly. It
had everything important packed up into a small, intuitive UI, so I could easily
add animations to my game. All I needed was
[this](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/animation/introduction.html)
official, written tutorial!

In general, Godot's limited number of features make it feel less bloated; the
things that the engine _does_ focus on is all high-quality and easy to use.

## The Node Tree

While both Unity and Godot have the concept of a node tree, Godot's
implementation of it is much more robust. In Godot, you can only put one script
on each node. I like this restriction â€“ it forces you to design better
components for your game in the end.

Also, **everything** is a node! This makes it super easy to reason about
everything. Even game scenes themselves are nodes! Implementing more advanced
features for scene loading in Unity can be a pain, since scenes are their own
concept. In Godot, scenes, game objects, and components all share one common
denominator, so implementing things like preloading, scene transitions, and
parameterization is way easier.

For example, here's some scene-loading code in my game:

```gdscript
func _goto_mission() -> void:
	var new_scene := _load_scene(_mission_scene)
    # This is a effectively scene parameterization
	if weather:
		new_scene.add_child(weather)
	new_scene.add_child(mission)
	mission.mission_finished.connect(return_home)

func _load_scene(scene: PackedScene) -> Node:
    # Free the old scene root
	get_tree().root.get_child(-1).free()
	var new_scene = scene.instantiate()
    # Add the new scene root
	get_tree().root.add_child(new_scene)
    # This isn't strictly necessary; some Godot APIs just expect this value to
    # be properly set
	get_tree().current_scene = new_scene
	return new_scene
```

`_goto_mission` essentially injects things into the new scene depending on
existing state. In Unity, this is much harder to do, and far less clean.

## Editor & Compiler

The Godot development experience is **fast**. Not only UI is intuitive and
snappy, I spend almost no time waiting for my game build and boot up. Unity
build times can be painfully slow at times.[^builds] And the UI can become
laggy/unresponsive after the app stays open for a while.

Godot rarely has these problems. And, if I ever do run into anything unusual, it
takes almost no time to quit and re-open the app!

## Mergability

Resolving Git merge conflicts in Godot projects is not nearly as hard as it is
in Unity. Both game engines store files in plain text, but Godot's format is
**way more human-readable**. Here's an example of a Godot scene file:

```gdresource
[gd_scene load_steps=4 format=3 uid="uid://bm0hxwrfnl0cc"]

[ext_resource type="Script" path="res://scripts/ui/lightning_indicator.gd" id="1_qnc1m"]

[sub_resource type="StyleBoxFlat" id="StyleBoxFlat_eba51"]
bg_color = Color(0.215902, 0.215902, 0.215902, 1)

[sub_resource type="StyleBoxFlat" id="StyleBoxFlat_vrxf2"]
bg_color = Color(0.838505, 0.770122, 0.196965, 1)

[node name="LightningIndicator" type="ProgressBar"]
offset_right = 448.0
offset_bottom = 42.0
theme_override_font_sizes/font_size = 30
theme_override_styles/background = SubResource("StyleBoxFlat_eba51")
theme_override_styles/fill = SubResource("StyleBoxFlat_vrxf2")
show_percentage = false
script = ExtResource("1_qnc1m")
```

It's generated by the editor, but it would still be really easy to edit it by
hand! This is what a Unity scene file looks like, truncated:

```yaml

PrefabInstance:
  m_ObjectHideFlags: 0

  m_Modification:
    serializedVersion: 3

      objectReference: {fileID: 0}
    m_RemovedComponents: []
    m_RemovedGameObjects: []
    m_AddedGameObjects: []
    m_AddedComponents: []
```

Before, my team and I would do anything to avoid a Unity merge conflict, because
resolving massive diffs that include snippets like the one I showed above is
nearly impossible.

# Pain Points

These are some of the pain points I've had with Godot thus far. I'm sure I'll
have more when I get to know the engine more, but as of this post, my list of
complaints is quite small!

## Dynamically Typed

I wish GDScript was statically typed. It supports type hinting, and using them
seems to be the norm (as opposed to a language like Python), but I still wish it
was **fully** statically typed.

This is definitely a personal preference, but I just like the safety of knowing
the types of absolutely everything.

## Breakage

Godot isn't afraid to break APIs. This is both a blessing and a curse. On one
hand, it enables some of the other things I
[talked about earlier](#economy-of-features), but on the other, it means that a
lot of things I read on forums or other blogs are **out of date**, and include
APIs that don't work anymore or a slightly different.

This was pretty annoying when I first started learning, but ultimately I
realized that the best way to learn Godot is through their
[official website](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/index.html). They
maintain it very well!

# Wrap-Up

Godot has answered pretty much all of my major annoyances with Unity. My overall
experience with it has been **very pleasant**, and my team and I have been able
to get _a lot_ done despite being new to the engine. I'm sure that I'll find
more things that I wish were improved upon as I use it more, but I would still
_absolutely_ recommend trying it out to anyone interested.

As always, I hope you enjoyed this post! If you found any issues or feedback,
please feel free to send an email or submit an issue on this website's
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/dzfrias/website).

[^hindsight]:
    That is, the mistakes/annoying parts of other high-level game engines like
    Unity and Unreal are well-known, so Godot has the opportunity to sidestep
    such issues without breaking old stuff.

[^problem]:
    Part of the problem with Unity in this respect is that it's so old. A lot of
    useful APIs (like events/signals) have subpar interfaces. They feel tacky.

[^builds]:
    Yes, I know that build times are a marginal (pretty much non-existent)
    concern when talking about the quality of video game. But long build times
    are _real_, and they _do_ hurt iteration capabilities. I remember watching
    the creators of [Golang](https://go.dev/) give a talk about why they made
    the language, and they cited C++ build times as one of the major reasons!
