<h1>Welcome</h1>

This is the personal website of **Diego Frias**. I write about programming and
feature some of the [projects](/projects/) that I'm working on. My
[blog](/blog/) contains a lot of programming-related writings. Sometimes it's a
tutorial, sometimes it documents something that I've done, and sometimes it
features a project of mine.

Check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/dzfrias) for an up-to-date
collection of all the things I'm working on!
